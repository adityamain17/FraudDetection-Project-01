💳 Financial Fraud Detection – SecurePay Analytics
📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world financial fraud detection scenario for a credit card provider.
The objective is to detect unusual or fraudulent transactions using a hybrid approach:

• Excel – Data preprocessing & exploration
• SQL – Structured business insights
• Python (Isolation Forest) – Anomaly detection
• Power BI – Interactive dashboards & reporting

👉 This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates how financial institutions combine data engineering, machine learning, and BI visualization for fraud detection & compliance monitoring.

🗂️ Dataset & ER Model

• Dataset: Provided in Excel/CSV format
• Features:
 • Numeric: TransactionAmount, CustomerAge, TransactionDuration, LoginAttempts, AccountBalance
 • Categorical: Occupation (Doctor, Engineer, Retired, Student), Transaction Channels (ATM, Branch, Online, CreditCard, DebitCard)
 • Derived: Log-scaled transaction amount, transaction time (hour, day, month), days since previous transaction
• ER Diagram created for schema clarity & relationship mapping

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

• Excel → Cleaning, derived features, pivot tables & charts
• SQL (MySQL) → Transactional queries, business insights, fraud risk indicators
• Python (Scikit-learn) → Preprocessing, anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
• Power BI → Dashboards for fraud monitoring & reporting
• Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI visuals

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Excel – Data Foundation

• Loaded & cleaned dataset
• Derived new features (log-transformed amounts, transaction times)
• Pivot tables & charts for initial exploration

2️⃣ SQL – Business Insights

• Total transactions: 2,512
• Debit usage higher than Credit usage
• ATM transactions had the highest average values
• Fort Worth → busiest transaction location
• Doctors held higher balances | Students contributed the most revenue
• High login attempts correlated with high transaction amounts → potential fraud risk
• High-value transactions (>1000) flagged; Portland = anomaly hotspot

3️⃣ Python ML – Isolation Forest

• Preprocessed data (scaling, encoding categorical variables)
• Trained Isolation Forest (contamination=0.05)
• Added Anomaly_Flag (1 = Fraud, 0 = Normal) + anomaly scores
• Result: ~6% anomalies detected (30/503 test samples)

4️⃣ Power BI – Interactive Dashboards

• Transaction volume by channel & location
• Occupation-wise account balances & spending
• Fraud risk by login attempts & transaction amount
• High-value anomaly tracking
• Real-time monitoring for decision makers

🔑 Key Insights

• Students contribute the most transaction volume (revenue)
• Doctors hold the highest balances
• Fort Worth is the busiest location
• Portland showed suspicious high-value transactions
• ATM transactions carry higher average amounts → fraud hotspot

🎯 Learning Outcomes

• Hands-on experience with an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline
• Integration of Excel, SQL, Python, and Power BI into one workflow
• Practical knowledge of unsupervised ML anomaly detection
• Business insights generation using SQL & visualization
• Real-world exposure to financial fraud detection & risk monitoring
